1.1.0:
- Major update. Now PUN Rally is PUN Combat Rally:
	- Completely new Weapon system
	- Extensible Powerups, with ammo, speed-up, speed-down, etc;
	- Tested on mobile platforms;
- Revised GUI code;
- Some minor bug fixes.

1.0.6b:
- Bug fixes at the end of the race:
	- number of laps is fixed (2/2, no 3/2 anymore);
	- Formatted time (00:00:000);
	- corrected bug that kept counting the time for some cars, and had flipped positions;
- Bug fixes in Menu scene:
	- If player creates a race and then uses the back button, the next race it created would
	be labeled with a random/garbage string. Fixed for keep on using the player nickname;

1.0.6:
- Simple weapon system;
- End race panel;
- Refactoring of GUI code, making it more modular (necessary because of the new panel);
- Back button (car selection back to race/room creation/joining);
- Bug correction: Wait for all players to load scene before countdown;
- Extensibility: template code car custom color sent via Photon (lacks a color pick and
	applying to materials);

1.0.5:

- Car physics tweaks for improved stability and control easyness;
- Mobile controls (accell and brake as screen buttons and tilt steeering);
- Track selector with three tracks (two new): master client can choose tracks, while the 
	others can see which track is being selected in realtime;
- Auto-unflip car (dot product based upside-down detection + auto unflip - good for mobile);
- Wrong way computation (also dot product based);
- Updated PDF Tutorial (1.0.5);
- All tracks now have a start/finish mark;
- New CarInput class separates input gathering from application on car in different
	methods, making it suitable for inheritance (check the online forums to get sub-classes
	that act as bridges for other car physics packs such as Edy's Vehicle Physics and
	Realistic Car Controller);

TODO for 1.0.7
- Auto-numbering of players with equal nickname;
- one or two new weapons;
- integration with "Randomnation 2.0" and "funcar kit" car physycis packs;
